# Hello-world
Idiot's first guide
So I'm an idiot trying to learn the language of software programming. 

Deploy, commit, branch are all handled differently in Infrasturcuter builds. 

I suck at programming, but the bigger problem is that I don't know the language yet. 
Programming is logic and syntax, that can be worked out. 
Learning the workflow is a very differnt process than my standard experience with Systems Engineering.
